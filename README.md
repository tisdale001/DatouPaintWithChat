This was final project for Foundations of Software Engineering. C++ networking project that was a basic paint program where multiple users could log on and paint together. It also had a chat function where users could send messages. Highlighted an undo/redo function that allowed users to undo or redo entire brushstrokes. Command pattern was used to accomplish this. For my part in the group: provided the majority of the starter code, wrote the ‘paintbrush’ function by myself, supervised merges to Github, pair-coding.
